# Clothing-E-commerce-Application Project - OOP Course

Description
The Clothing E-commerce project is developed as part of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course using Java. It aims to simulate an online clothing store, providing users with a platform to browse and purchase clothing items. The project demonstrates the application of object-oriented principles and design patterns in the development of a real-world software application.

Features
The Clothing E-commerce project offers the following features:

User Registration and Authentication: Users can create an account, log in, and manage their profile information. Authentication ensures secure access to the platform.

Product Catalog: The application provides a comprehensive catalog of clothing items, organized by categories, such as men's wear, women's wear, and accessories. Users can browse through the catalog and view detailed information about each product.

Shopping Cart: Users can add products to their shopping cart, review the cart contents, and proceed to checkout. The shopping cart maintains the selected items and calculates the total price.

Order Management: After placing an order, users can track the status of their orders, view order history, and manage cancellations or returns.

Payment Integration: The application integrates with a payment gateway to facilitate secure online transactions. Users can choose from multiple payment methods, such as credit cards, PayPal, or other supported options.

Search and Filtering: Users can search for specific products using keywords and apply filters based on attributes like price range, size, color, or brand.

Wishlist: Users can create and manage a wishlist of desired clothing items. They can save products for future reference or purchase.

Rating and Reviews: Users can provide ratings and reviews for products they have purchased. This feature helps other users make informed decisions and provides valuable feedback to the store.
